Having read about the grid-tools and the serialbox now it is a time to learn how to efficiently test our implementation of a stencil against some baseline.

## Things to cover:

1. Calling Fortran code to generate the baseline data and using it
2. Efficient layout of multiple dwarfs (file structure and how to use it)
