Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool. You can download it with `sudo apt install puppet` on any Ubuntu/Debian Linux.

There is a very convenient editor for editing the puppet manifest files, Gepetto. You can either download it and install as a stand-alone product, or download it as a plugin for the resent Eclipse. In the latter case click `Help`->`Install new software...` and in the `Install` dialog box under `Work with:` type in the following URI: `http://geppetto-updates.puppetlabs.com/4.x.`. Press enter, wait a moment when Eclipse fetches all packages from the typed in address and select **Gepetto for Eclipse IDE**.

The plugin checks syntax, formats the puppet code and gives you context-aware typying completion.
